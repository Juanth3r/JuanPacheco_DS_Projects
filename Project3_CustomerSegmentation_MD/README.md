# Customer Segmentation for Marketing Optimization

## Project Overview
In today's competitive market, understanding customer behavior is essential for businesses to optimize their marketing strategies. This project focuses on customer segmentation using machine learning techniques to group customers based on purchasing behavior, demographics, and engagement metrics.

By leveraging **unsupervised learning**, businesses can:
âœ… Personalize marketing campaigns  
âœ… Improve customer retention  
âœ… Optimize product recommendations  

## Business Case
The **Marketing Department** aims to classify customers into different segments to optimize advertising and engagement strategies. Using clustering techniques, we can extract insights from customer data and create actionable marketing strategies.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project comes from **Kaggle** and contains credit card transactions of customers. It includes information such as:
- **Balance**: Remaining balance in a customerâ€™s account  
- **Purchases**: Amount of purchases made  
- **Credit Limit**: Customer's credit limit  
- **Payment Behavior**: Payment frequency and amount

## Steps in the Analysis

1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: Define business objectives  
2. **Data Preprocessing & Exploration**: Handle missing values and normalize features  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize customer behavior patterns  
4. **Apply K-Means Clustering**: Identify customer groups  
5. **Find Optimal Clusters**: Use **Elbow Method & Silhouette Score**  
6. **Enhance Segmentation with PCA & Autoencoders**: Dimensionality reduction techniques  

## Machine Learning Techniques Used
- **K-Means Clustering**: To segment customers based on spending behavior  
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: To reduce dimensionality and improve clustering accuracy  
- **Autoencoders (Deep Learning)**: For high-dimensional feature extraction  

## Key Findings
- Using **K-Means**, we identified **7 optimal customer segments**.
- **PCA helped reduce noise** and improve cluster separation.
- **Autoencoders** further enhanced segmentation performance.
- Insights from the clusters allow businesses to **target specific customer groups with personalized marketing strategies**.

## Technologies Used
âœ… **Programming Languages**: Python  
âœ… **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow  
âœ… **Clustering Algorithms**: K-Means, PCA, Autoencoders  
âœ… **Data Visualization**: Seaborn, Matplotlib
